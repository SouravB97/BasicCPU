-Made a true accumulator with a flop, mux and two tristate gates and the ALU
-This solved the timing problem of ALU result changing back to A
-Earlier Control unit was clocked by clk1. This was wrong as data was getting latched by just the 0.1ns delay of the decoder output
-Changed CU clk to clk2. Now there are no XX, and its beautiful waves in every operation
-Logical operations are working!
